title: Welcome to Tobi Oloke

This website is a personal project as I develop on my Haskell and 3D Realtime Graphics/GameDev journey.

I learned Haskell as a route to get into developing Plutus on Cardano. What ended up
happening was that I fell in love with Haskell and wanted to cultivate an even deeper
knowledge of it and apply it to more and more things. At ``$DAYJOB`` I tend to write more C and Python
but always leveraging the useful Haskell techniques that I've learned along the way that I will
write in this blog.

As of writing it has been 2 years since I started working in Software Engineering and the more I learn
the lower level I want to get. I enjoy writing in C, learning x86 ASM, and even some circuitry
for electrical engineering. Some of these projects will begin to pop up on this blog over time.
