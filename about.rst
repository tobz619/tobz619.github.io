title: Welcome to Tobi Oloke

This website is a personal project as I develop on my Haskell journey.

I learned Haskell as a route to get into developing Plutus on Cardano. What ended up
happening was that I fell in love with Haskell and wanted to cultivate an even deeper
knowledge of it and apply it to more and more things.

This has led to the creation of this website as well as other bits of problem solving
that I want to accomplish such as games, useful apps: both web and local; and FPGA development.
